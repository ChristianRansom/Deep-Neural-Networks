Learning the workings of Neural Networks and Deep Learning

I've decided to explore Neural Networks and Deep learning with a goal of eventually building an 
AI that can learn to play Snake. 


I want to learn about the deep inner workings of Neural Networks and Deep learning so I plan to 
build as much as I can from scratch. However, since I'm starting out without really any machine 
learning knowledge, its difficult for me to plan out my class structure and plan out a clear end goal. 
I'm probably going to be producing many different versions and doing a lot of refractoring.

Progress:
This network is capable of solving the XOR problem with the ability to have multiple hidden layers and through the use of back propagation. It is capable of regression and classification. The next step is to work towards reinforcement learning.
