Learning the workings of Neural Networks and Deep Learning

I've decided to explore Neural Networks and Deep learning with a goal of eventually building an 
AI that can learn to play Snake. 


I want to learn about the deep inner workings of Neural Networks and Deep learning so I plan to 
build as much as I can from scratch. However, since I'm starting out without really any machine 
learning knowledge, its difficult for me to plan out my class structure and plan out a clear end goal. 
I'm probably going to be producing many different versions and doing a lot of refractoring.
